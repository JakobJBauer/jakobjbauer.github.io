I am an MSc student in Computer Science at ETH Zurich, specializing in Machine Intelligence with a focus on Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP). My current research interests include Data Augmentation, NLP in Education, Constrained Decoding, and the Verifiability of AI-Generated Content. My ongoing projects include constraining LLM outputs using Context-Free Grammars, enhancing the semantic parsing capabilities of [Math World](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04347), and evaluating the performance of State Space Models across various NLP downstream tasks. 

Additionally, I am one of two research engineers collaborating with the [European Union Aviation Safety Agency](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en) on pioneering the certification of an LLM-based pilot assistance model in Europe.

I am actively seeking PhD positions in these areas of interest, or related fields, starting from September 2025.

Beyond my academic pursuits, I am a dedicated scout and enjoy immersing myself in a good book, especially during a rainy train ride.

Feel free to reach out or take a look at my CV!
